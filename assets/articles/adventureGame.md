# Project Title: **Adventure Quest**

## Project Overview
"Adventure Quest" is a 2D platformer game being developed using the Godot Engine. The game features a player-controlled character that interacts with a dynamic environment using physics-based mechanics. The objective is to navigate through levels, overcome obstacles, and reach the final goal.

## Project Progress

### 1. **Player Creation**
- Designed the player character.
- Implemented movement controls (walk, jump, crouch, etc.).
- Added player animations for different states (idle, running, jumping).
- Integrated player physics using RigidBody2D/KinematicBody2D for realistic movement and collision.

### 2. **Physics and World Environment**
- Established a physics-based world environment.
- Configured gravity, friction, and collision layers for player and environment interaction.
- Applied static bodies for ground and obstacle platforms.
- Integrated dynamic objects (like movable boxes, bouncing objects, etc.).

### 3. **Level Design - Level 1**
- Created the layout of the first level (Level 1).
- Designed various obstacles and platforms for the player to interact with.
- Added basic environmental elements like background scenery, ground textures, and platforms.
- Implemented checkpoints and level boundaries.

## Next Steps
- Add enemy AI and interactions (patrolling enemies, damage systems, etc.).
- Develop a scoring/points system for player achievements.
- Implement a health system and game-over conditions.
- Expand level design and create additional levels.
- Add audio elements (background music, sound effects for actions).
- Polish UI elements such as menus, HUD, and pause screens.

## Project Goals
- Create a fully functioning 2D platformer with smooth physics-based movement.
- Deliver an engaging and challenging gameplay experience across multiple levels.
- Integrate user-friendly UI and provide feedback through sound and visual effects.

## Tools Used
- **Engine**: Godot Engine
- **Language**: GDScript (for scripting game logic)
- **Assets**: Placeholder sprites for player and environment
